## Introduction
The Dining Philosophers Problem embodies the challenges of resource allocation and synchronization in multi-threaded environments. This repository offers two solutions, each demonstrating different concurrency mechanisms using mutexes/threads (`philo` directory) and semaphores/processes (`philo_bonus` directory).

## Directory Structure
- `philo`: Mutexes/Threads solution.
- `philo_bonus`: Semaphores/Processes solution.

## Running the Code
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the chosen directory: `philo` for mutexes/threads, or `philo_bonus` for semaphores/processes.
3. Open your terminal and execute the following commands:
   ```shell
   make
   ./philo
  ```
or
```shell
  make
  ./philo_bonus
```

## Program Arguments
To run the program, provide the following arguments:

- `number_of_philosophers`: Specifies the number of philosophers and forks.
- `time_to_die` (in milliseconds): Defines the maximum time a philosopher can go without eating before they perish.
- `time_to_eat` (in milliseconds): Represents the time a philosopher takes to consume a meal, holding two forks.
- `time_to_sleep` (in milliseconds): Sets the duration a philosopher spends sleeping.
- `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`: Optional argument. When specified, the simulation halts after all philosophers have eaten the designated number of times. If not provided, the simulation stops upon a philosopher's demise.
